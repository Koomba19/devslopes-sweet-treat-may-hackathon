# Dev Notes
While the repo was made earlier, I never really gave this any time. It's currently 6/2. The hackathon is due in less than 31 hours from the time of writing. I finally entered a period of time where I can, responsiblity free, take all the time in the world to work on this. Might as well also try out this polyphasic sleep pattern I heard about. Apparently humans can go off of catnaps for a week or two at a time. Thomas Edison was reported to do this, so that's a stamp of approval if I've ever heard one.

To be made as they come up  

## Plan  
So grid the first 9 tiles. 
- Top row, Header 
- Bottom row, Footer
-  Center row: Cash Register, Flavor, Easel.  
I'm thinking of trying to make it so that you can only pick one flavor and one kind of cone at a time, utilizing radio buttons on two input forms.  
The footer will have a pretty picture under the flavor column, and a shoutout or something for under the register. A stylized price thingamajig will exist on the flavor counter.
